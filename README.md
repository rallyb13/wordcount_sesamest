Welcome to Benjamin Herson's Count My Word site, using the frequency method.
This is a Ruby method, running on a website built by Sinatra. MIT license.

Please feel free to try and break my method. I'm happy to have feedback.
As of now, I've tried to include defenses against obvious tricks.
(e.g.: If your keyword isn't in the sentence you provide, The Count will know.)

Thanks!
