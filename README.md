Welcome to Benjamin Herson's Count My Word site, using the 
defined method: frequency. This is a Ruby method, 
running on a website built by Sinatra. MIT license.

Please feel free to try and break my method. I'm happy to have feedback.
As of now, I've tried to include defenses against obvious tricks.
(e.g.: If your keyword isn't in the sentence you provide, The Count will know.)

I killed my only known bug by plugging an if statement INTO the actual app.rb
file. If someone sees a better way to deal with The Count's use of the
plural/singular, please let me know.

Thanks!
